name: The Angiosarcoma Project - Count Me In (Provisional, April 2025)
description: The Angiosarcoma Project (<a href="https://www.ascproject.org">www.ascproject.org</a>)  is an ongoing patient-driven initiative. This provisional dataset is currently derived from 351 samples, including tumor specimens (FFPE and cfDNA) from 297 angiosarcoma patients subjected to whole-exome sequencing (along with matched germline whole-exome sequencing). This study includes genomic data, medical record data (MedR), and pathology report data (PATH). All annotations have been de-identified. As these data were generated in a research laboratory, not a clinical laboratory, they are for research purposes only and cannot be used to inform clinical decision-making.
