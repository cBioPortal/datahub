name: The Angiosarcoma Project - Count Me In (Provisional, April 2025)
description: The Angiosarcoma Project is an ongoing patient-driven initiative. This provisional dataset is currently derived from 328 samples, including tumor specimens (FFPE and cfDNA) from 274 angiosarcoma patients subjected to whole-exome sequencing (along with matched germline whole-exome sequencing). This study includes genomic data, medical record data (MedR), and pathology report data (PATH). All annotations have been de-identified. As these data were generated in a research laboratory, not a clinical laboratory, they are for research purposes only and cannot be used to inform clinical decision-making. For questions about these data, including how to cite, please direct questions to <a href="mailto:data@ascproject.org">data@ascproject.org</a>.
