description: Whole-exome sequencing of 134 nerve sheath tumor samples with their matched normals. The raw data is contributed by Johns Hopkins University researchers funded by the Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Acceleration Program (NTAP). The reprocessing of the raw data is managed by the NF Open Science Initiative (<a href="https://nf.synapse.org/">NF Data Portal</a>). The original raw data was reprocessed with updated genome build and filtered to remove low confidence variant calls, and any common variants that had a gnomAD allele frequency (for any subpopulation) greater than or equal to 0.0005.
