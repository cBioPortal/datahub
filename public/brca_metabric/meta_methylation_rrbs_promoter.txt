datatype: CONTINUOUS
stable_id: methylation_rrbs_promoter
show_profile_in_analysis_tab: true
profile_description: Average methylation (beta-values) of promoters defined as 500bp upstream & 50 downstream of Transcription Start Site (TSS). With coverage >= 20 in 70% of the tumor samples and 70% of the normal samples. For genes with multiple promoters (alternate), the promoter with minimum methylation in the normal tissues is selected
