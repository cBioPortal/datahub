ccle_genetech_2014 Study Curation 

Clinical Data
Supplementary Table 1
Patient/Sample ID transformation: 
Cell line ID -> Patient/Sample ID
Oncotree codes based on tissue diagnosis (general code used for diagnoses with no oncotree codes)

Gistic Data
Supplementary Table 4: Results for GISTIC analysis run on 610 cell lines

Mutation Data
Supplementary Data 3: All single nucleotide mutations found in cell lines in this study. 
Data was transformed to MAF format and annotated using Genome Nexus

Structural Variants
Supplementary Table 8: Gene-gene fusions identified in cancer cell lines
Gene fusion data was used to obtain structural variant data using the fusion-to-sv-converter script from the Data Curation Tools


Expression Data
Supplementary Data 1: Gene expression read counts for all coding genes


Notes: 
-White space in original sample ID was replaced with - or no space
-"S-" and "P-" prefix for sample and patient IDs
