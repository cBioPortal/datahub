description: Multi-region, multi-modal profiling of 42 untreated high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients. This study reports an integrative analysis of mutational processes and their impact on the tumor microenvironment using single-cell RNA sequencing, whole-genome sequencing, targeted sequencing (MSK-IMPACT), digital histopathology and multiplexed immunofluorescence. The study is part of a prospective research program to understand the spatio-temporal determinants of HGSOC evolution, treatment and response (MSK SPECTRUM: Memorial Sloan Kettering - SPatio-temporal Evolution in Cancer TRaced Using Multi-modalities).
