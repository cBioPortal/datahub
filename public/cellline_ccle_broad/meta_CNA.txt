profile_description: Putative copy-number calls in 972 samples determined by GISTIC2: -2 = homozygous deletion; -1 = hemizygous deletion; 0 = neutral / no change; 1 = gain; 2 = high level amplification. GISTIC2 was run using the GenePattern website, using the CCLE segmented data downloaded from the CCLE website and all the default parameters, except the confidence, which we increased from 0.75 to 0.99.
