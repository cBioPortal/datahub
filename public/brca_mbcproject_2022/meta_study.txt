description: The Metastatic Breast Cancer Project (<a href="https://mbcproject.org/">www.mbcproject.org</a>) is an ongoing patient-driven initiative. This dataset release is derived from 379 samples, including both primary and/or metastatic tumor specimens (FFPE) from 301 patients who developed metastatic breast cancer. 379 samples have undergone whole-exome sequencing (along with matched germline whole-exome sequencing) and 157 of those samples have also undergone RNA-sequencing. This study includes genomic data, patient-reported data (prepended as PRD), medical record data (MedR), and pathology report data (PATH). All annotations have been de-identified. As these data were generated in a research laboratory, not a clinical laboratory, they are for research purposes only and cannot be used to inform clinical decision-making. For questions about these data, including how to cite, please visit <a href="https://mbcproject.org/data-release">www.mbcproject.org/data-release</a> or direct questions to data@mbcproject.org.
