A value of >= 1% indicates an ER Positive tumor.	Progesterone Receptor (PR) status as reported in the pathology report 	Progesterone Receptor (PR) percentage reported in the pathology report. A value of >=1% indicates a PR Positive tumor.	HER2 status reported in the pathology report	"HER2 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results in the pathology report. This test involves staining tissue samples and looking at them under a microscope to determine if the HER2 protein is overexpressed in the sample. Results can be reported as 0+, 1+, 2+, or 3+. 0+ and 1+ indicate a HER2 negative tumor, 2+ is considered equivocal and may require further testing, and 3+ indicates a HER2 Positive tumor."	"HER2 Flourescence In Situ Hyrbridization (FISH) results in the pathology report. This is most commonly performed on tumor samples with a HER2 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) score of 2+, or equivocal. This is an additional test that aims to measure whether or not the HER2 gene is overexpressed in a tumor sample."	"Ratio of HER2/CEP17 in the pathology report. This is one component of the Flourescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) test. This ratio is used to determine if the HER2 gene is overexpressed, relative to the CEP17 protein, which acts as a baseline measurement. HER2/CEP17 ratios >2.2 indicate a HER2 Positive tumor."	"Copy number of HER2 in the pathology report. This is the number of copies of the HER2 gene seen in the sample, which is used to calculate the HER2/CEP17 ratio.
