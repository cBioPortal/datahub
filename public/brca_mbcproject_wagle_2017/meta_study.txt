description: The Metastatic Breast Cancer Project is a patient-driven initiative. This study includes genomic data, patient-reported data (pre-pended as PRD), medical record data (MedR), and pathology report data (PATH). All of the titles and descriptive text for the clinical data elements have been finalized in partnership with numerous patients in the project. As these data were generated in a research, not a clinical, laboratory, they are for research purposes only and cannot be used to inform clinical decision-making. All annotations have been de-identified. More information is available at www.mbcproject.org. Questions about these data can be directed to data@mbcproject.org.
