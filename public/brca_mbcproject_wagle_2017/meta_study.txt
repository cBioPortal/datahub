short_name: The MBC Project
description: This release of the Metastatic Breast Cancer Project dataset is derived from 237 samples, including both primary and/or metastatic tumor specimens (FFPE) from 180 patients who developed metastatic breast cancer. 237 samples have undergone WES (matched germline WES) and 146 of those samples have also undergone RNA-sequencing. The MBC Project is an ongoing patient-driven initiative. All of the data and descriptions of the data were generated in partnership with patients. This study includes genomic data, patient-reported data (pre-pended in this dataset as PRD), medical record data (MedR), and pathology report data (PATH). As these data were generated in a research, not a clinical, laboratory, they are for research purposes only and cannot be used to inform clinical decision-making. All annotations have been de-identified. More information is available at www.mbcproject.org.
