profile_description: Genetic ancestries were determined using five different methods as described in Carrot-Zhang et al (2020). These consensus calls were created based on the ancestral population that received the majority of assignments for each patient. The original data is <a href="https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/CCG-AIM-2020">here</a>.
