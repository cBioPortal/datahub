profile_name: Treatment response: Z-score of IC50
profile_description: Z-scores of the ln-transformed IC50 values of drug-treated cell lines. These Z-scores represent the relative (standardized) inhibitory potency of each drug over every cell line treated with that drug. The IC50 values were intra-/extrapolated from a sigmoidal curve, based on a mixed-effects model (Vis et al. 2016).
