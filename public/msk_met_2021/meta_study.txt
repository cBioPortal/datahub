description: MSK-MET (Memorial Sloan Kettering - Metastatic Events and Tropisms) is a pan-cancer cohort of tumor genomic and clinical outcome data from 25,000 patients. The dataset identifies associations between tumor genomic alterations and patterns of metastatic dissemination across 50 tumor types; showing that chromosomal instability is strongly correlated with metastatic burden in some tumor types, like prostate and lung adenocarcinomas and HR+/HER2+ breast ductal carcinoma, but not in others, such as colorectal MSS, pancreatic adenocarcinoma and high-grade serous ovarian cancer. It also identifies somatic alterations associated with increased metastatic burden and routes of metastatic spread. Our data offers a resource for the investigation of the biologic basis for metastatic spread and highlights the role of chromosomal instability in cancer progression.
