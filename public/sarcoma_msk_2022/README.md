Data Curation and Transformation 

Data retrieved from supplementary files
Study pmid: 35705558
Reference genome: GRCh37

Clinical Data
	* Data retrieved from supplementary table, sheet 'samples_table_final_for_supplem'
	* Oncotree codes inferred from Final Diagnosis.
	* For final diagnoses that cannot be mapped to an oncotree code, the most relevant oncotree code was used as shown below:
- OS (485): including Osteosarcoma (460) + Extraskeletal osteosarcoma (25) 
- Sarcoma, NOS (1458): including Sarcoma, nos (1286) + Sarcoma, unclassified (172)
- MFH (325): including UPS/MFH (329) + UPS/MFH of bone (23)
- MT (13): for Kaposi
