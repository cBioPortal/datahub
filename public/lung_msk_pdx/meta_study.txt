name: Thoracic PDX (MSK, Provisional)
description: Targeted sequencing of thoracic PDX lines to characterize genetic alterations in 318 tumor/normal pairs via MSK-IMPACT. This cohort is a PDX tracker of all lung cancer PDX generated at MSK that have been through IMPACT sequencing. This is a live datafeed, increasing over time, not published as a cohort. When published on particular models, sequencing data would be made available in a stand-alone cohort, for example cohort "SCLC multi institute, Cancer Cell 2017 (sclc_cancercell_gardner_2017)".
