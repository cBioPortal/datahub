datatype: CONTINUOUS
stable_id: rna_seq_mrna
show_profile_in_analysis_tab: FALSE
profile_name: Pseudo bulk mRNA expression (log CPM)
profile_description: The bulk RNA-seq counts were calculated from scRNA-seq, by averaging the raw expression counts per sample across the cells. The averaged raw counts are CPM normalized with log(1+x) transformation.
