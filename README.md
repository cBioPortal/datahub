Validation status of latest studies added to this repo: [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/cBioPortal/datahub.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/cBioPortal/datahub)

# cBioPortal Public Datahub
The datahub is a repository for store data only. It contains staging files which are pre-validated and can be loaded directly into the cBioPortal.

Behind the scenes git-lfs is used to manage the large files. https://github.com/github/git-lfs

## How to Download Data
### Downloading zip files individual studies
At [cbioportal.org](http://www.cbioportal.org/data_sets.jsp) a zipped folder with staging files from each study can be downloaded. These zip files are compressed versions of the study folders in the master branch of this repository.

### Example downloading individual study with git-lfs
It is also possible to download uncompressed staging files from this repository with git-lfs.

After you have installed git-lfs, configure it not to download all data files right away:
```
git lfs install --skip-repo --skip-smudge
```

Clone the git repository and install lfs hooks into it:
```
git clone https://github.com/cBioPortal/datahub.git
cd datahub
git lfs install --local --skip-smudge
```

Download the data files for a study folder, for example brca_tcga:
```
git lfs pull -I public/brca_tcga
```
