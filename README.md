# cBioPortal Public Datahub
The datahub is a repository for store data only. It contains staging files which are pre-validated and can be loaded directly into the cBioPortal.

Behind the scenes git-lfs is used to manage the large files. https://github.com/github/git-lfs

## Test Status
Validation status of all studies on Datahub master branch. This runs weekly using the validation code from the cBioPortal master branch. It also validates if the studies on cbioportal.org and on Datahub are in sync.

## How to Download Data
### Downloading zip files individual studies
At [cbioportal.org](http://www.cbioportal.org/data_sets.jsp) a zipped folder with staging files from each study can be downloaded. These zip files are compressed versions of the study folders in the master branch of this repository.

### Example downloading individual study with git-lfs
It is also possible to download uncompressed staging files from this repository with git-lfs.

After you have installed git-lfs, configure it not to download all data files right away:
```
git lfs install --skip-repo --skip-smudge
```

Clone the git repository and install lfs hooks into it:
```
git clone https://github.com/cBioPortal/datahub.git
cd datahub
git lfs install --local --skip-smudge
```

Download the data files for a study folder, for example brca_tcga:
```
git lfs pull -I public/brca_tcga
```

## How to Upload Data
